This repository contains a demonstration of a common bug in F# involving mutable variables and function parameter passing. The bug arises from a misunderstanding of how mutable variables are handled within functions.  The `bug.fs` file shows the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.fs` demonstrates the correct solution.
